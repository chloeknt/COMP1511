[COMP1511 Extension Work]

Write a summary of how you made the changes that you did:

[E1:Summary] {{{
I have made several changes that allowed me to implement Night Mode when the 
shift-left command is pressed. I created another array called night_map and 
another print function to be able to print out this map First, I changed the 
block input requirements so it would accept negative numbers and scan them 
into the night_map array. Then I duplicated the main function and changed it 
to affect the night_map, and duplicated the extra day_map functions and changed
them to affect the night_map as well. I made changes to the end condition for
shooting the laser to ensure both maps had to be cleared before the Game Won! 
prompt.

I then created two tests, 
- Test 1 tests the rotate only once rule regardless of which map
- Test 2 which tests the left shift end condition for the night map

Write two tests to test your implementation of Extension 1 ("Night Realm").

[E2:Summary] {{{
I have made several changes that allowed me to implement Mirror Blocks when the value of the blocks were input as 2 and the laser was fired. I added another possibility in the main function, that a value in the array could be 2, and this would commence a new function for destroying up to two blocks of either side perpendicular to where the mirror block is placed. Within this function I set an index that would make the loop go through the perpendicular blocks on either side up to two times. I then set those array indexes to the value of 0 (EMPTY). I also added another while loop into 

I then created two tests, 
- Test 1 tests that the code disregards out-of-bounds indexes 
- Test 2
